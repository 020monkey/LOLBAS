# Contributing

First, thank you for contributing!

When submitting new LOLs, please submit a `yml` sourcefile (`yml/`) as these are used to generate everything else. Next, review `README.md` and ensure that your LOL meets the criteria--interesting or unexpected functionality that would be useful to an attacker.

There's nothing special about the format. Just base your entry off an existing one and modify as required. Please ensure that you do not add or remove any of the fields; all are required.
